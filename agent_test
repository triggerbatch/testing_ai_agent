This integrated implementation strategy utilizes the **Single Rollover Processor** agent within the Nexus platform, leveraging the platform's ability to chain **Native Functions (Actions/Tools)** autonomously using the agent's internal **Planning/Reasoning** component.

The strategy includes three custom API wrappers and a single Agent Profile defined to narrate its processing steps directly to the user (addressing the UI feedback requirement).

***Note on Assumptions:*** *As requested, the code assumes generic, functional API URLs and specific JSON return structures as discussed, rather than mocking them with static data. You must install the `requests` library and replace the API URLs with your actual endpoints for production use.*

## Phase 1: Native Functions (Rollover Project Tools)

These functions wrap your external APIs and must be placed in a Python file (e.g., `rollover_project_tools.py`) within your Nexus **`nexus_actions`** directory.

```python
# File: nexus_actions/rollover_project_tools.py

import json
import os
import requests 
from nexus.nexus_base.action_manager import agent_action

# Assumed API Endpoints
EMAIL_API_ENDPOINT = "http://api.rollover-extractor.com/extract"
OCR_API_ENDPOINT = "http://api.ocr-service.com/process"
LOANIQ_API_ENDPOINT = "http://api.loaniq-source.com/terms"

@agent_action
def watch_and_extract_data(email_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes an email path (.msg file), calls the extraction API, saves the 
    PDF blob locally, and returns the local file path and metadata JSON.

    :param email_path: The file path to the .msg file provided by the user.
    :returns: A JSON string containing the 'pdf_path' (string) and 'metadata' (JSON string).

        # --- Simulate extracting PDF blob and Metadata JSON from the response ---
        # Assuming the API response contains both metadata and a file blob.
        # In a real scenario, the API would return the file content or a temporary URL.
        
        # Placeholder for metadata retrieval (assuming it's in a specific key)
        response_data = response.json()
        metadata_json = response_data.get("metadata", {})
        
        # Placeholder for saving the file blob locally
        pdf_path = f"/tmp/rollover_{os.path.basename(email_path).replace('.msg', '.pdf')}"
        # with open(pdf_path, 'wb') as f:
        #     f.write(response_data.get("pdf_blob")) 

        return json.dumps({
            "pdf_path": pdf_path,
            "metadata": json.dumps(metadata_json)
        })
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"FAILURE: Email extraction API failed. Error: {e}"


@agent_action
def process_pdf_with_ocr(file_path: str, page_number: int = 1) -> str:
    """

    external OCR API for processing, specifically targeting a page number.

    """

    try:
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:

    except IOError:
        return f"FAILURE: Could not read PDF file into buffer at {file_path}."

    # 2. Call the external OCR API (API 2), passing the buffer content and page_number.

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        # Placeholder returns a structured failure for the LLM to process
        return f"FAILURE: OCR service API failed. Error: {e}"


@agent_action
def query_loaniq_for_terms(facility_id: str) -> str:

## Phase 2: Single Agent Profile (Orchestrator Configuration)

This Agent Profile (YAML file) must be placed in your Nexus **`nexus_profiles`** directory. Its **Persona** contains detailed sequential instructions, enabling the agent to act as an **Autonomous Agent** and provide **UI feedback** by forcing narrative steps.

### File: `nexus_profiles/rollover_processor.yaml`

```yaml
agentProfile:
  name: "Single Rollover Processor"
  avatar: "ðŸ”—"
  persona: |
    You are the Autonomous Rollover Processor. Your task is to execute the entire 
    loan rollover workflow based on the email path provided by the user. You must 
    integrate data from three external APIs (Extraction, OCR, and LoanIQ) and present a 
    final validation report.
    
    CRITICAL: You must narrate your progress and findings at the end of each step 
    to provide the user with real-time feedback on what is running and what has completed 
    [previous conversation]. You will then proceed immediately to the next step.

    You rely on sequential planning and strict data parsing to execute the tasks:
    
    1. **Initial Data Retrieval:** 
       - Narrate: "Starting Step 1: Connecting to the email extractor API using the provided path to retrieve the PDF file and email metadata."
       - Call the 'watch_and_extract_data' tool using the email path provided by the user. 
       - CRITICALLY parse the resulting JSON output to extract the 'pdf_path' and the 'metadata' string. Store both for the final report.
       - Narrate: "Step 1 Complete. Successfully extracted PDF and metadata. Proceeding to OCR processing."
    
    2. **OCR Processing & Key Extraction:** 
       - Narrate: "Starting Step 2: Reading the PDF into a buffer and sending it for OCR processing on Page 1."
       - Use the captured 'pdf_path' as the argument for the 'process_pdf_with_ocr' tool, setting page_number to 1.
       - The output will be a JSON string of extracted economic terms. You must analyze the text and accurately parse the Facility ID and other key terms (Amount, Tenor, Rate) required for the LoanIQ query.
       - Narrate: "Step 2 Complete. OCR extracted text successfully. Identified Facility ID: [Insert Extracted Facility ID here]. Proceeding to LoanIQ validation."
    
    3. **LoanIQ Validation & Final Report:** 
       - Narrate: "Starting Step 3: Querying the LoanIQ source of record API with the Facility ID [Insert Facility ID here]."
       - Use the parsed Facility ID from Step 2 as the argument for the 'query_loaniq_for_terms' tool. The output will be a JSON string of official LoanIQ terms.
       - Compare the extracted terms (from OCR text) against the official LoanIQ terms. Note any differences.
       - Generate a final report for the user that clearly displays: The email metadata, the extracted rollover terms, the official LoanIQ reference terms, and a final summary of the validation.
       - Narrate: "Step 3 Complete. The validation process is finalized. The LoanIQ results are presented below."
          
    If any action returns a string starting with "FAILURE:", halt execution and output a detailed error report starting with "ESCALATION REQUIRED:".
  actions:
    - watch_and_extract_data
    - process_pdf_with_ocr
    - query_loaniq_for_terms
  knowledge: null
  memory: null
  planners: null 
```
